1. Similar to electricity starting about 100 years ago, AI is transforming multiple industries.
2. 	a. We have access to a lot more computational power.
	  b. We have access to a lot more data.
3. 	a. Being able to try out ideas quickly allows deep learning engineers to iterate more quickly.
	  b. Faster computation can help speed up how long a team takes to iterate to a good idea.
	  c.  Recent progress in deep learning algorithms has allowed us to train good models faster (even without changing the CPU/GPU hardware).
4. False
5. Figure 3
6. False
7. False
8.	a. It can be trained as a supervised learning problem.
	  b. It is applicable when the input/output is a sequence (e.g., a sequence of words).
9. x-axis is the amount of data		y-axis (vertical axis) is the performance of the algorithm.
10. a. Increasing the training set size generally does not hurt an algorithm’s performance, and it may help significantly.
	  b. Increasing the size of a neural network generally does not hurt an algorithm’s performance, and it may help significantly.
